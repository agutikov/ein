  asked             all of R — describe
  states (k_s)      0
  commitments (k_c) 0
  exhausted         yes — every commitment is classified: this is all of R
  empty             every alive node owes — no commitment pays every debt
  lattice           monotone (the static check) — R is convex: no hole
  universe          no candidate: R is {∅} or empty, decided by root alone
  route             the state route, every alive state once — L1 dead is upward-closed · L3 a commitment's state is its closure's · L4 the lines are local
  work              1 saturation · 0 facts beyond root · 2 layers
