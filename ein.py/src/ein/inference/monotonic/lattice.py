"""Lattice data structures for the unified set-search engine.

The single :func:`solve` entry attaches a :class:`LatticeProof`
artefact to its verdict when called with ``store_lattice=True``. This
module defines the proof's data shape + the per-record companion
types + the cumulative-counters class :class:`LatticeStats`. The proof
carries BOTH views off the one run: the gaps view is
:attr:`LatticeProof.solutions`, the contradictions view is
:attr:`LatticeProof.dead_commitments` (+ the verdict's ``unsat_core``).
