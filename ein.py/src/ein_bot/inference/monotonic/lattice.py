"""Lattice data structures for the unified set-search engine.

The :func:`gaps_solve` and :func:`contradictions_solve` entries
(siblings of :func:`solve` in this same package)
return verdicts wrapping a :class:`LatticeProof` artefact. This
module defines the proof's data shape + the per-record companion
types + the cumulative-counters class :class:`LatticeStats`.
