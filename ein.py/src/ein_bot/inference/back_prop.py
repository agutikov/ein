"""Unconditional-death analysis + back-prop write — S1.5.7 T1.5.7.1 / .2.

A hypothesis branch dies *unconditionally* when its contradiction
rests on no speculative fact other than the branch's own hypothesis
``h``: the death proves ``¬h`` in the parent node's context, so
``(not h)`` may be written into the parent KB (T1.5.7.2) — where it
becomes an O(1) ``_negated_facts`` filter entry every sibling and
descendant inherits.

A *conditional* death — one whose contradiction additionally rests on
some **other** hypothesis — is held back from the (irreversible)
parent write by the ``enable_back_prop_unconditional`` gate.

``unsat_core`` membership
-------------------------
:meth:`KnowledgeBase.unsat_core` walks each conflict witness's
derivation DAG to its ``source`` / ``hypothesis`` / un-provenanced
terminals. A dead branch's core therefore *always* contains the
branch's own seeded hypothesis ``h`` (a hypothesis-kind terminal of
the conflict). :func:`is_unconditional_death` is told which
hypothesis is ``h`` via ``own_hypothesis`` and treats it as a benign
terminal — otherwise no death would ever read as unconditional.

The remaining judgement is a transitive premise walk. The shallow
read — *"the core contains no ``kind='hypothesis'`` fact"* — is
unsound: a core fact can be ``kind='rule'`` yet derive, through a
chain of firings, from a hypothesis. The shared provenance walk
:func:`~ein_bot.kb.provenance.reaches` (with a hypothesis terminal)
follows ``Provenance.premises_raw`` (resolved against the KB) until
every chain grounds out at a ``source`` / un-provenanced given, or
any chain reaches a ``hypothesis`` / ``rejected`` terminal that is
not ``own``.

    The negation is a REASONING-layer ``(not <hypothesis>)`` fact

    derivation walks back to the same given facts the death rested
    on. Indexing it updates ``kb._negated_facts``, so every
    subsequent ``_candidates_for`` / ``_prune_alive`` drops
    ``hypothesis`` in O(1), and ``kb.fork()`` carries the exclusion
    to descendant branches.

    **Transitive bubble-up (S1.5a.14).** Because the death is
    unconditional — its premise chain reaches no speculative fact —
    ``(not h)`` is provably true in *every* ancestor's context, not

    writes carry the rule-name suffix ``-bubbled`` so traces show
    which writes were lifted from a deeper level.

    ``rule_name`` distinguishes the back-prop's origin in traces and
    audits (T1.5.7.2 ``<back-prop-unconditional>`` for consume-loop
    kills, T1.5.7.4 ``<lookahead-dies-immediately>`` for S1.5.6

    keys on ``is_symmetric`` nowhere.

    Idempotent: a pre-existing ``(not h)`` at any level is returned
    untouched.

    Returns the *primary* stored ``(not …)`` Fact in ``kb``.

    **Eager mode (S1.5a.17).** When :data:`_eager_pass_ctx` is set
    (the outer driver bound a pass id), this function raises
    :class:`BubbleAbort` after writing if at least one *new* fact
    was added (idempotent re-writes don't trigger). The chain's
